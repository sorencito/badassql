# planspy
Adds execution plan support for some popular databases to p6spy. It's an extension to p6spy, so it will not work without it.

This is work in progress. 

# motivation 

I'm working on this because I've found myself in serious trouble regarding performance of large scale enterprise applications using Java and any OR mapper. Normally performance issues do not show up until in a production like systems and I want to provide a tool that fishes out common problems with OR mappers along the way while developing the software. The main usecase thus is to run it with your unit tests for DAOs. 

# usage

Follows once ready.
