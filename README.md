# planspy
Adds execution plan support for some popular databases to p6spy. It's an extension to p6spy, so it will not work without it.

This is work in progress. 

# motivation 

I'm working on this because I've found myself in serious trouble regarding the performance of large scale enterprise applications using Java and any OR mapper. Normally performance issues do not show up until in a production like systems and I want to provide a tool that fishes out common problems with OR mappers along the way while developing the software. p6spy is a great tool that allows to easily look at the SQL generated by OR mappers even in unit tests (unlike AppDynamics or DynaTrace). Anyway, sometimes nice looking SQL does not work as expected due to missing indices or whatever other reasons. I find it useful to look at those execution plans in early stages and analyse least those which may have a problem in detail. The main use case thus is to run it with your unit tests for DAOs against the database you're using in production (or very similar).
I'll go into the details of the sense of all of this once there is something valuable to show off.

# usage

Follows once ready.
